\noindent The trusted communication unit~(TCU) is a building block that can be used to construct
secure systems. As shown in \rref{fig:sysoverview}, the system consists of multiple processing
elements~(PEs), each containing a compute unit~(CU) and a TCU. The PEs are linked through some
interconnect (e.g., a network-on-chip) and are split into \emph{kernel PEs} and \emph{user PEs}. The
former are privileged and manage the TCUs of the user PEs, whereas the latter are unprivileged.

In this system, the TCU, the interconnect, and the kernel PEs are trusted (shown green), whereas the
CUs in the user PEs are untrusted (shown red). By default, all PEs are isolated from each other, but
communication channels between PEs can be established. These communication channels can only be
establish by kernel PEs, but can be used afterwards by user PEs. Which PEs are kernel PEs is defined
by the TCU's \texttt{FEATURES} register. At boot, all PEs are kernel PEs, which can be changed by
the kernel booting on one specific PE before the other PEs start.

User PEs can have different complexities, mostly driven by the used CU. The left user PE uses a
simple core with scratchpad memory and a basic TCU without extensions. The right user PE uses a
complex core with caches and virtual memory support and a multiplexer (Priv) that supports multiple
applications on the same PE. These features require TCU extensions for virtual memory (\extbox{vm})
and PE sharing (\extbox{pemux}). This specification highlights the portions that are required by
only one extension in its color and portions that are required by either extension as
\extbox{vmpex}.

  \caption{The internal organization of a PE.}
  \label{fig:peinternal}
\end{figure}

\rref{fig:peinternal} shows the internals of a processing element~(PE). The compute unit~(CU) is
connected to the trusted communication unit~(TCU) and can access the TCU's registers via memory
mapped input/output (MMIO). Additionally, the CU is connected to the local memory. The TCU is also
connected to the local memory to, for example, access messages. These components are not necessarily
arranged in this way. For example, the TCU might interpose itself between the CU and local memory.

To support the security model introduced in \rref{sec:systemoverview}, the registers are split into
different groups, each group having different access permissions. All registers are generally
readable. \emph{External registers} can only be written externally, that is, from a remote PE. They
are intended for the kernel PE to manipulate the state of remote TCUs. \emph{Endpoint registers} can
be written externally and locally by the kernel PE. \emph{Unprivileged registers} can be written by
the CU. In consequence, only kernel PEs can \emph{establish} communication channels by writing
endpoint registers, but user PEs can \emph{use} these communication channels through the
unprivileged registers.

\extstart{vmpex} The \emph{privileged registers} are intended for privileged software running on PEs
that are multiplexed among multiple VPEs and/or use virtual memory. The privileged software should
make sure that unprivileged software running on the same PE cannot access the privileged registers.

\section{Registers}

The TCU has several registers that are accessible through memory-mapped input/output~(MMIO). The
memory interface from CU to TCU is expected to be 64-bit wide. The MMIO region of the TCU is defined
as follows:
