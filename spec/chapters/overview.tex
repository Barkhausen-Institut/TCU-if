\noindent The trusted communication unit~(TCU) is a building block that can be used to construct
secure systems. As shown in \rref{fig:sysoverview}, the system is based upon a tiled architecture
and each tile contains a compute unit~(CU) and a TCU. The tiles are linked through some interconnect
(e.g., a network-on-chip) and are split into \emph{kernel tiles} and \emph{user tiles}. The former
are privileged and manage the TCUs of the user tiles, whereas the latter are unprivileged.

In this system, the TCU, the interconnect, and the kernel tiles are trusted (shown green), whereas the
CUs in the user tiles are untrusted (shown red). By default, all tiles are isolated from each other, but
communication channels between tiles can be established. These communication channels can only be
establish by kernel tiles, but can be used afterwards by user tiles. Which tiles are kernel tiles is defined
by the TCU's \texttt{FEATURES} register. At boot, all tiles are kernel tiles, which can be changed by
the kernel booting on one specific tile before the other tiles start.

User tiles can have different complexities, mostly driven by the used CU. The left user tile uses a
simple core with scratchpad memory and a basic TCU without extensions. The right user tile uses a
complex core with caches and virtual memory support and a privileged software (Priv) that enables
multiple applications on the same tile and/or virtual memory. These features require TCU extensions
for virtual memory (\extbox{vm}) and/or tile sharing (\extbox{tilemux}). This specification highlights
the portions that are required by only one extension in its color and portions that are required by
either extension as \extbox{vmtilex}.

  \caption{The internal organization of a tile.}
  \label{fig:tileinternal}
\end{figure}

\rref{fig:tileinternal} shows the internals of a tile. The compute unit~(CU) is
connected to the trusted communication unit~(TCU) and can access the TCU's registers via memory
mapped input/output (MMIO). Additionally, the CU is connected to the local memory. The TCU is also
connected to the local memory (SPM or cache) to, for example, access messages. These components are
not necessarily arranged in this way. For example, the TCU might interpose itself between the CU and
local memory.

To support the security model introduced in \rref{sec:systemoverview}, the registers are split into
different groups, each group having different access permissions. All registers are generally
readable. \emph{External registers} can only be written externally, that is, from a remote tile. They
are intended for the kernel tile to manipulate the state of remote TCUs. \emph{Endpoint registers} can
be written externally and locally by the kernel tile. \emph{Unprivileged registers} can be written by
the CU. In consequence, only kernel tiles can \emph{establish} communication channels by writing
endpoint registers, but user tiles can \emph{use} these communication channels through the
unprivileged registers.

\extstart{vmtilex} The \emph{privileged registers} are intended for privileged software running on tiles
that are multiplexed among multiple activities and/or use virtual memory. The privileged software should
make sure that unprivileged software running on the same tile cannot access the privileged registers.

\section{Registers}

The TCU has several registers that are accessible through memory-mapped input/output~(MMIO). The
memory interface from CU to TCU is expected to be 64-bit wide. The MMIO region of the TCU is defined
as follows:

\section{Error List}

The TCU uses the following error codes to provide feedback to the software for failed commands:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{NONE} (0): no error (success),
  \item \texttt{NO\_MEP} (1): no memory endpoint,
  \item \texttt{NO\_SEP} (2): no send endpoint,
